# hello-world

Hi readers,

I'm a biochemist from New Zealand. I'm interested in human disease research - particularly diseases where your own body 'rebels' against itself - autoimmune illnesses are an example. 
Also a huge fan of the environment and trying to preserve and save it. 
And in my spare time I hike, read a lot of books, write a little and walk the dog.
